# Nessus – Wonders for Vulnerability Management

The tool called Nessus helps to scan devices in the network. There are many scans types can be done in-order to get results for individual systems. In this part of the project we are using basic scans and all the things we can get only by basic scanning. The basic scans are to find vulnerabilities shown from the networks point of view, an example for the fingerprinting scans from Nmap scans to get services and operating systems running from opened ports.

This may sound like nessus gets more information from basic scanning than Nmap but these are two different tools, but the comparison is between the information gathering than the actual use case for Blue team or red team.

### How to scan???

At the initial scan, only 1 medium and 30 info risk factors are found. Surely this is wrong, but because it is only getting from network POV, without any additional scans, this is the highest we could achieve.

Nessus also supports credentialed scans. Which can show the information that has more deep-dives on deprecated software, drivers, dlls. Files and more. Whilst Nessus is connected online (even with essentials), you get Synopsis, Description, See Also Solution, Risk Factor, CVSS v3.0 (Base/Temporal Score), CVSS v2.0 (Base/Temporal Score), Plug-in information, Plug-in Output

##### Nessus Basic scan → Report → HTML
The report can get Host specfic vulnerabilities scans, although I only scanned fresh windows 10, for which I didn’t select a host for a report for the entire scan.

##### The report has 5 risk factors (High to Low);- Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info
 As the names suggests the Critical effect is has higher success rate when being exploited. For example, the most Critical vulnerability after credentialed scan is Microsoft Internet Explorer ‘Unsupported Version Detection’ . Under description, ‘Lack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor. As a result, it is likely to contain security vulnerabilities.’ From my analysis, the typical windows 10 ships with an IE browser that can executed which can allow drive-in downloads, activeX, Adobe Flash and Javascripts exploits. Additionally forceful Pop-ups in IE can postpone users from using their device and malicious actions can take place.

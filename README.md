#### Proof Of Concept for Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus

Proof Of Concept for Vulnerability Management with Vulnerability Assessment tools such as Nessus and mitigate as much scanned threats as possible. 

## Nessus
The use of nessus is really powerful. The first scan of a fresh Windows 10 installation contained a SMB issue (more on this later). Nessus has a option to login Windows 10 VM for scanning the registry and other places you cannot access with a basic scan without credentials. 

### Aim
Focus on findinf misconfigurations and deprecated software to understand my the adquate skills needed to find during scans and mitigate them based on the risk factor (corralate with the threat impact level of Nessus)

### When am I putting up the evidence
After a days when I try to research more about Nessus to find more issues. Trying with Metasploitable VM will show more misconfigurations to address.
